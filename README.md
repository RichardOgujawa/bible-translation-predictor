This is an API which which has a model under the hood which is used to make predictions about which bible translation a particular verse is being read from.
<br/>

## Why? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The Bible began as a collection of writings largely inscribed in three languages: **Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek.** Over time the Scriptures were translated into over **700 languages** to accommodate believers in different nations, and within each language potentially exists a handful, if not several hundred translations. **In the Enlgish language alone ‚Äùapproximately 500 ... versions** of the complete Bible have been written over the last few hundred years. Of those, nearly **100 versions are currently in print**.‚Äù ([Faith Founded on Fact](http://faithfoundedonfact.com/how-many-versions-bible/), 6)

Popular versions include ASV (American Standard Version), BSB (Berean Study Bible) and KJV (King Kames Version), however even given the awareness of these popular translations, **it‚Äôs not always easy to identify which one is being used at any given time**. Along with this, although some people who preach or read from the Bible preface their reading of the verse or passage with the translation they‚Äôre reading from, this often is not the case. **As such people often find themselves either scrambling to find the version as the speaker reads on, or they simply acquiesce to following along with a version that communicates a similar meaning but with different phraseology.**
<br/>

## Goal üéØ

The goal of this project is to **remove the friction between the people trying to follow a reading or preaching and the reader or preacher**, allowing the reader to read whichever translation suits them without the risk of people potentially struggling to follow along.
